# EarthGuesser
A very original web game I came up with, not a copy of some other not free game at all. As you can see the name is also very original.

## How it works?
Umm, you are placed in some random city in street view, and you have to guess where you are by placing a point on a map. The closer you are, the more points you get.

## Technologies and stuff
The app uses Next.js and Postgree SQL, Google Maps, and Tailwind.

## Progress made:
- [x] Project created
- [x] Got Google Maps api (scaryðŸ˜¦)
- [x] Created the core gameplay functionality
- [x] Created authentication
- [ ] Created leaderboard
- [ ] Made welcome page, naviagtion and stuff.
- [ ] Icons, meta tags, and stuff like that.
- [ ] Deplyment!


## Note

Uhhh, IDK if I'm allowed to do that, but I had to modify random-streetview a little, so now I don't use the package but have the copied code instead.

Also I had to generate random locations in browser so I had to implement some
weird anti-cheating solutions.
