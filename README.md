# EarthGuesser
Welcome to EarthGuesser repo. EarthGuesser is a rip-off of the web game GeoGuessr. I decided to make this one becuase GeoGuesser isn't free, and it seemed like a fun project idea.

The website is live at [earth-guesser.kdown.space](https://earth-guesser.kdown.space)

## Note

Uhhh, not sure if I'm allowed to do that, but I had to modify random-streetview a little, so now I don't use the package but have the copied code instead.
Attribution to the original package:
